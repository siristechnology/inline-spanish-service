For example, saving\nfeedback message when user submits through contact form\n[https://siristechnology.com/contact].\n\nAnd, it is not feasible or economical to create/deploy/host a complete new app\nfor such a tiny service.\n\nSO, WHAT CAN WE DO?\nGatsby is not great at proxying api calls in production environment. This link\n[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/api-proxy/] only works in dev environment.\n\nCOUPLE OF OPTIONS\n * gatsby exports all html into /public folder. You can simple serve static\n   files through your express app.\n\n> app.use(express.static(${__dirname}/public`)) e.g. link\n[https://github.com/siristechnology/siris-technology/blob/master/server.js#L12]\n\n\n * Another easy solution is to run gatsby serve and node express in the same\n   port. You can make express run in background daemon using libraries likepm2 .\n\n> web: pm2 start ecosystem.config.js — env production && gatsby serve -p $PORT -H\n0.0.0.0\n\n\n * Netlify function [https://functions-playground.netlify.com/] is a great\n   example and perfect for this type of scenario (static website with some api\n   support through function). Netlify free [https://www.netlify.com/pricing/] \n   tier is also adequate for most of the small scale websites, however, the\n   price rises sharply after that."
